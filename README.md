**Project Overview Report**

**Objective:**  
Provide insights into which departments and projects are at risk of being over budget or underperforming. The focus includes examining 2-year budget intervals, identifying critical projects or departments, and organizing data for actionable insights.

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Sources:** Imported data related to employee information, salary data, department budgets, and project details.
   - **Data Cleaning and Sorting:** SQL was used to clean and organize data, ensuring all relevant columns (e.g., employee information, salary data, department budgets, project budgets) were structured for easy access and integration into Power BI.
   - **Data Transformation:** Power Query was utilized in Power BI for further data manipulation, ensuring accurate aggregation of costs and budgets over 2-year intervals.

### 2. **Key Findings**
   - **Departments at Risk of Being Over Budget:**  
     The IT department shows potential budget overrun with a capital cost of $770,000 against a budget of $900,000.
   - **Project Insights:**  
     The dashboard highlights various projects and their respective budgets. Key areas of concern include projects nearing or exceeding their allocated budgets, such as the "Mobile App Development" and "New Marketing Campaign."
   - **Employee Cost Impact:**  
     Employee salary data was mapped by department to show the cost impact on each department's budget, with IT and Human Resources having higher salary allocations.

### 3. **Dashboard Overview**
   - **Department Overview:**  
     A pie chart provides a breakdown of project costs by department, visually representing the capital distribution and identifying departments with significant allocations.
   - **Budget Analysis by Department:**  
     A bar chart compares the project and department budgets, highlighting over-budget areas.
   - **Project Status Tracking:**  
     A segmentation view allows for quick filtering of project statuses (e.g., ongoing, upcoming, completed) to understand the progress and budget utilization for each.
   - **Detailed Employee View:**  
     A drill-down section for individual employees provides a comprehensive view of their role, salary, department, and project involvement, which helps in tracking individual cost contributions.

### 4. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
   - **Resource Allocation:**  
     Redistribute resources from departments that are within budget to those nearing or exceeding their budget to avoid potential financial strain.
   - **Cost Control:**  
     Monitor ongoing projects closely, particularly those in the IT and Marketing departments, to prevent budget overruns.
   - **Regular Review:**  
     Regular updates and reviews every quarter are recommended to manage budget performance effectively, as well as to allow for necessary adjustments in the allocation.
